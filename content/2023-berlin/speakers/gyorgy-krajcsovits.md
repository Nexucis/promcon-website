Working at Grafana Labs

Senior Software Engineer at Grafana Labs. Everyone calls him by his nickname Krajo for obvious reasons. Krajo contributed to a number of backend system projects in various industries like telecommunications and IT security before joining Grafana Labs close to two years ago. Believes that features without tests and proper documentation do not exist and values these over very clean code. In his private life he likes to go hiking and geocaching.
