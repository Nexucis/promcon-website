## Scholarships + Travel Funding

The Dan Kohn scholarship fund exists to support individuals who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend in three categories:

## Diversity

Applicants must be from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the technology and/or open source communities who are unable to attend without financial assistance. Including, but not limited to people identifying as: LGBTQIA+, women, people of color, and/or persons with disabilities.

## Need-Based

Applicants should be active community members who are not being assisted or sponsored by a company or organization, and are unable to attend for financial reasons.

## Maintainer

Applicants should be active Prometheus maintainers who are not being assisted or sponsored by a company or organization, and are unable to attend for financial reasons.

Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Scholarships are NOT transferable to another person, or any other event. Selection will be made by reviewers who will assess each applicantâ€™s request. Application information will be kept confidential.
Scholarship recipients will receive a complimentary registration pass to attend PromCon EU 2023 in Berlin, Germany.
Travel funding scholarship recipients may receive up to a max of $1,000 USD to reimburse actual travel expenses. Please note that reimbursements are made after the event, and the stipend may only be used for the following: coach train, bus or airfare, hotel / accommodations (up to two nights), and transportation to and from the airport/train/bus station.
