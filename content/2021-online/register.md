## Register to attend

As PromCon is colocated with KubeCon, the registration for PromCon Online 2021 is an add-on to the KubeCon ticket.

CNCF supports active community members who are not being assisted or sponsored
by a company or organization, and are unable to attend for financial reasons.
[Apply here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/EU21ScholarshipApp) for a free ticket.
