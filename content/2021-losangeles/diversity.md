title: Diversity
---

Education and collaboration are vital to the future of the CNCF ecosystem, and
it is imperative to us that everyone in the community that wants to participate
feels welcome to do so regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age, religion or economic status. The
Linux Foundation [code of conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/code-of-conduct/)
outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as
well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
