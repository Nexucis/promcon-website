*This page will be updated regularly with information about our plan for health
and safety protocols onsite at PromCon North America 2021.  Our attendeesâ€™
health and safety remains our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19
and look to the venue, local, state, CDC, and WHO guidelines to make the best
and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.*

*Check back soon for additional guidance and protocols.*

## Current Onsite Requirements

In-person attendees will be required to be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19
virus and will need to comply with all on-site health measures, in accordance
with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation [Code of
Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/code-of-conduct/).
Fully vaccinated is defined as being two weeks out from receiving the final dose
of a government-approved vaccine.

## Current Onsite Health & Safety Measures

We are working with the venue and local municipalities to provide the following
safety measures for our event:

- Rigorous onsite cleaning and sanitizing of all touch points
- Temperature checks, where applicable
- Masks, where applicable. Attendees can expect that there will be elements of
  the event where masks will be required.
- Sneeze guards in the registration and food & beverage stations
- An onsite medical team daily
- Monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms
- Use of a digitally secure vaccine verification app to provide vaccination
  clearance safely and privately

At minimum, we will be following all mandated venue, municipality and CDC
guidelines.
