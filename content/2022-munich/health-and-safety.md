## Health & Safety

*Our attendees’ health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19 and look to venue, local, state, CDC, and WHO guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.*

In the interest of keeping our events accessible to as much of the community as possible while still making sure our community is safe and protected, we have updated our Health + Safety policies for PromCon EU 2022.

* All attendees must show proof of COVID-19 vaccination OR (1) negative COVID-19 test upon first entry to the event.
* We will no longer conduct daily temperature checks upon entry for attendees.
* <strong>Masks will still be required</strong> at all times unless actively eating or drinking, outdoors, or giving a keynote or breakout talk.

If you are traveling to Germany, review the entry requirements from your country of origin [here](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268). As of Saturday, June 11, 2022, all COVID-19 entry restrictions to Germany will be provisionally lifted. From this date, entries to Germany will again be permitted for all travel purposes (including tourism and visiting trips). We highly suggest visiting the Germany Federal Foreign Office website regularly for the most up-to-date information as your trip nears. Changes and updates are typically marked at the top of the page. Read carefully to ensure you have the most recent information regarding travel rules and regulations based on your country of origin. The requirements may change so continue to check back regularly.

**Note that entry to the event requires proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test, regardless of the Germany’s entry requirements.*

### Mask Mandate

**While many municipalities’ mask mandates have been lifted masks will still be required to be worn at the event.**

Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable material. KN95 or N95 masks are recommended. Cloth masks are acceptable. Bandanas, scarves, and gators are not permitted to be used as masks.

Masks do not need to be worn when in outdoor spaces and while actively eating food and beverage indoors when socially distanced from others. Speakers are not required to wear masks while presenting.

### Vaccine or Negative COVID-19 Test Requirement

All attendees **must show proof of COVID-19 vaccination OR (1) negative COVID-19 test** upon first entry to the event.

#### Vaccine Requirement

If you are showing proof of vaccination to attend in person, you will need to show that you are ‘fully vaccinated’ against the COVID-19 virus. Fully vaccinated is defined as two weeks (14 full days) after the final dose (1 of 1, or 2 of 2) of a vaccine approved for emergency or full use by the World Health Organization. View the most up-to-date list of accepted vaccines [here](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/).

The following are acceptable forms of proof of full vaccination:

* Government-issued or government-compliant digital vaccination verification app (such as Clear or VaxYes)
* Physical (or digital photocopy of) COVID-19 vaccination card, record, or certificate issued by a government agency, public health agency, or other authorized vaccine provider (a photo will also suffice).

The proof of vaccination record must show the name of the vaccinated individual along with one other personal identifier (such as date of birth or passport number), name of the manufacturer for vaccine received, and date(s) of vaccination. It must also include the name of the official source issuing the record (e.g., public health agency, government agency, or other authorized vaccine provider).

#### Negative COVID-19 Test Requirement

In lieu of proof of vaccination, participants may instead show proof of a negative COVID-19 test administered by a verified provider to enter the event.

* Provide (1) negative COVID-19 test upon entry to the event for the first time.
* The test must be a PCR, NAAT, or Antigen test taken within 24 hours of picking up your badge on-site.
* The test may NOT be an unproctored at-home test. Tests must be administered by a verified provider, either locally in Detroit or virtually before you travel from your home city (if time permits).
* The test results must include your name and the date and time of the test.

### Wearable Indicators of Social Distance Comfort Levels

We will provide a wearable indicator of social distance comfort levels for event participants to wear onsite (optional but encouraged). Participants are asked to be respectful of each other’s comfort level on social distance.
