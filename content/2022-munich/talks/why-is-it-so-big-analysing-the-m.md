## Why is it so big? Analysing the memory consumption of Prometheus

Speaker(s): [Bryan Boreham](../../speakers/bryan-boreham)

A large Prometheus instance may take 100GB of RAM, or even more.
In this talk I will walk through the main internal data structures that contribute to that size.

Talk should be of interest to anyone who would like their Prometheus to be a bit smaller.
Attendees will take away potential changes in configuration or workload that make the size go down.
