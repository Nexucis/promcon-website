## Using PromQL for Custom Datasources

Speaker(s): [Chris Marchbanks](../../speakers/chris-marchbanks)

Have you wanted to use PromQL to analyze data that is not stored in Prometheus? Perhaps there is no way to scrape the data either, for example if it is not available for hours or may change. This talk will demonstrate how you can use Prometheus code to create a PromQL interface to any data you choose. A concrete example will be shown that queries data from Strava via PromQL.
